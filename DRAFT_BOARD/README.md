## NBA 2025 Draft Board Website

I built a scouting platform for the NBA Draft designed to help teams evaluate prospects more effectively.  

### Features

- **Big Board**: Ranks all draft-eligible players on the homepage.  
  - Each player card displays rankings submitted by scouts.  
  - Scout ranks are **highlighted**:  
    - ðŸŸ¢ Green = higher than consensus  
    - ðŸ”´ Red = lower than consensus  
  - Includes a **search bar** to find prospects quickly.  
  - **Team filter** allows narrowing players by school.  

- **Player Profiles**:  
  - Clicking a player card opens their profile page.  
  - Profile includes **photo** and **combine measurements**.  

- **Player Card Toggles**:  
  - **Player Stats**: View detailed game logs or switch to season averages.  
  - **Scouting Reports**: Read reports from scouts or submit a new one via a built-in form.  

### Value

This application gives scouts and front office staff a streamlined, data-driven interface to:  
- Analyze player performance  
- Spot outlier evaluations  
- Document observations all in one place
