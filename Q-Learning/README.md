# 🎮 Project: Pac-Man AI with Search & Reinforcement Learning

## 📖 Overview
In this project, I implemented a variety of **search algorithms** and **reinforcement learning techniques** to enhance Pac-Man’s decision-making and pathfinding capabilities. The focus was on teaching Pac-Man to adapt its gameplay over time and optimize strategies for maximum food consumption and survival.

## 🚀 Features
- Implemented classic **search algorithms**:
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
  - **A\* Search** for optimal pathfinding  
- Developed a **Q-learning agent** that improved gameplay through reinforcement learning, allowing Pac-Man to learn strategies dynamically during play  
- Designed and tested **alpha-beta pruning agents**:
  - **Offensive Agent** → prioritized maximizing food capture  
  - **Defensive Agent** → focused on minimizing opponent score  
- Demonstrated effective results when agents were run with a **tree depth of 2**, balancing performance with computational efficiency
