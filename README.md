### **Project 1: NBA Draft Scouting Platform**
I built an NBA Draft scouting platform that streamlines prospect evaluation for teams by combining rankings, stats, and reports in one interface.  

**Key Features:**
- Homepage with a **Big Board** ranking all draft-eligible players  
- Color-coded scout rankings (green = above consensus, red = below consensus)  
- Search by player or filter by school  
- Detailed player profiles with photos, combine measurements, game logs, season averages, and scouting reports  
- Built-in form for scouts to submit new reports  
- Centralized system for tracking outlier opinions and performance trends

### **Project 2: Events Search App (Android)**
Built a full-stack, location-based **Android event discovery application** enabling users to search for nearby events, view detailed event information, and manage favorites with persistent storage.  

**Highlights:**
- Developed a responsive, **Material Design–compliant UI** using Kotlin, Android SDK, and Jetpack Compose  
- Designed and deployed a **scalable Node.js backend on Google Cloud Platform**  
- Integrated **Ticketmaster, Google Maps, and Spotify APIs** to deliver real-time event, venue, and artist data  
- Implemented **persistent favorites management with MongoDB Atlas**, allowing users to save and retrieve events across sessions

### **Project 5: NFL Chatbot**
Built an NFL chatbot powered by OpenAI’s Large Language Models to answer NFL-related queries.  

**Tech Highlights:**
- Stored 1000+ lines of raw NFL data as word embeddings in **Pinecone Vector Database**  
- Used semantic search to retrieve the most relevant information  
- Delivered accurate, context-aware responses to user questions

### **Project 8: N-gram Language Models**
Built unigram, bigram, and trigram language models to predict word sequences.  

**Evaluation:**
- Trained on text data to compute conditional probabilities  
- Measured model accuracy using **perplexity**  
- Compared performance across different n-gram sizes  

---

### **Project 9: Modular Code Processing (MCP) Server**
Created an intelligent Q&A system using **FastAPI**, **OpenAI GPT-4**, and the **Wikipedia API**.  

**Highlights:**
- Modular API endpoints for Wikipedia search, summary retrieval, and chatbot interaction  
- LLM dynamically extracts and synthesizes relevant information from external tools  
- Demonstrated orchestration of tool use for context-aware responses
