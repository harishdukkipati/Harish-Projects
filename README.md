Here are 2 projects that I have completed over the past year. 
Project 1: I developed a multi-threaded HTTP server using C, which involved creating multiple threads, implementing a bounded buffer, and utilizing mutex locks to ensure an atomic and coherent processes. 
Project 2: I effectively employed Q-learning, depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search algorithms in Python to enhance Pac-Man's gameplay. This optimization was done to improve both its decision-making process and pathfinding for maximum food consumption
