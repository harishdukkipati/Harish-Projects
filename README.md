## Projects Completed

Here are 7 projects that I have completed over the past year.

### **Project 1: NBA Draft Scouting Platform**
I built an NBA Draft scouting platform that streamlines prospect evaluation for teams by combining rankings, stats, and reports in one interface.  

**Key Features:**
- Homepage with a **Big Board** ranking all draft-eligible players
- Color-coded scout rankings (green = above consensus, red = below consensus)
- Search by player or filter by school
- Detailed player profiles with photos, combine measurements, game logs, season averages, and scouting reports
- Built-in form for scouts to submit new reports
- Centralized system for tracking outlier opinions and performance trends

### **Project 2: Multi-threaded HTTP Server (C)**
I developed a multi-threaded HTTP server using C, which included:
- Creating multiple threads
- Implementing a bounded buffer
- Utilizing mutex locks to ensure atomic and coherent processing

### **Project 3: NBA Stat Predictor (Python)**

I developed a FFN model to predict the stats of Pacers and Thunder Players during the 2025 NBA Finals:

### **Project 4: NFL Chatbot**
Built an NFL Chatbot powered by OpenAI’s Large Language Models to answer NFL-related queries.  

**Tech Highlights:**
- Stored 1000+ lines of raw NFL data as word embeddings in **Pinecone Vector Database**
- Used semantic search to retrieve the most relevant information
- Delivered accurate and context-aware NFL answers

### **Project 6: Slack App Clone**
Developed a Slack-like messaging app using:
- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

**Features:**
- Stored and retrieved user workspace, channel, and message data
- Integrated backend server calls to display information seamlessly

### **Project 7: N-gram Language Models**
Built unigram, bigram, and trigram models to predict word sequences.  

**Evaluation:**
- Trained on text data to calculate probabilities based on preceding context
- Measured accuracy using **perplexity**
- Compared model performance in capturing language patterns

---

### **Project 8: Modular Code Processing (MCP) Server**
Created an intelligent Q&A system using **FastAPI**, **OpenAI GPT-4**, and the **Wikipedia API**.  

**Highlights:**
- Modular API endpoints for Wikipedia search, summary retrieval, and chatbot interaction
- LLM dynamically extracts relevant info from external tools
- Demonstrated orchestration of tool use for context-aware responses
